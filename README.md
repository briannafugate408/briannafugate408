Hey, my name is Brianna Fugate. ðŸ‘‹

I was born and raised in NYC, but moved to Atlanta, Georgia after graduating from Spelman College with my B.S. in Computer Science. My favorite color is blue. I love great books, good food, and spending time with family. My side passion is real estate and beautiful homes. 

After college, I worked for Mailchimp for 3 years initially on the Landing Pages team which transitioned to a new product offering: Websites. I currently work at Samsara on the Connected Equipment team where we focus on the client side full-stack development for Samsara's device offerings.
